   			<p> Hey, so I have to say something about myself.
 I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read peopleâ€™s mind. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
